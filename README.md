## How to Run Locally

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

   ```zsh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Server** Start the Express server by running:

   ```zsh
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server, and it will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Heroku

To push your updated project to Heroku, follow these steps:

1. **Login to Heroku:** If you're not already logged in, open your terminal and run:

   ```zsh
   heroku login
   ```

2. **Add Heroku Remote (if not already added):** If the Heroku remote isn't linked to your project, add it by running:

   ```zsh
   heroku git:remote -a <your-heroku-app-name>
   ```

3. **Push to Heroku:** Once you've committed your changes to GitHub and your Heroku remote is set, push the changes to Heroku by running:

   ```zsh
   git push heroku main
   ```

4. **Check Logs:** After pushing, you can check the logs to make sure the deployment was successful by running:

   ```zsh
   heroku logs --tail
   ```

   This should deploy your updated code to the existing Heroku app.
